## A new blog for the new year

Yeah i know it's almost june, but the idea for this was last year. (Author note (of 2021, it is now 2023 at the date of publication))

### Introduction

I used to have a blog, still available at [jibhaine.fr](https://jibhaine.fr), i gave it up around the time social networks rose to popularity and everyone that had a blog was posting stuff on facebook or twitter.
There are too many social networks today, having control of what everyone publishes.
This site is my attempt at taking back what i can of my identity online.

### What you'll find here

mainly articles about web development, tutorials on angular, and other technologies if i'm motivated.

Think pieces about development practices in teams, about our sausage society.

### Technical stack & roadmap

This "blog" is built with [angular](https://angular.io) and [analog](https://analogjs.org)
I'll build it in the open on [github](https://github.com/benjilegnard/resum), here are some of the features planned :

**Technical roadmap**

- [x] generate article pages from markdown with front-matter
- [x] internationalization english / french
- [x] RSS feed
- [ ] links to share articles on social network
- [ ] projects list / timeline type of content
- [ ] analytics ??
- [ ] reactions on blog posts

I'll try to keep this list updated.

Be seeing you :wave:
